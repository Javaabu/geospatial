# Geospatial

:::danger

This package is currently under development. If anything works, that's a surprise.

:::

[Geospatial](https://github.com/Javaabu/geospatial) adds Geospatial attribute support to Laravel projects.

This package is an extension to [Laravel Eloquent Spatial](https://github.com/MatanYadaev/laravel-eloquent-spatial), mainly adding support for testing with sqlite, and other helpful functionalities. This documentation will contain the extra features added on top of the original package.
